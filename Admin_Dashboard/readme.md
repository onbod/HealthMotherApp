## üåê Standards Alignment: DAK, FHIR, and SMART

HealthyMother is designed to align with leading digital health standards for interoperability and scalability:

### DAK (Digital Adaptation Kits)
- The app's workflows and data structures are inspired by WHO's DAKs, ensuring alignment with global best practices for maternal health.
- Patient journeys, visit schedules, and reporting follow DAK recommendations for digital health systems.

### FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)
- Patient, encounter, and observation data structures are modeled after FHIR resources.
- The codebase includes utilities for converting app data to FHIR-compliant formats, enabling future integration with other FHIR-based systems.
- This ensures data can be exchanged with EHRs, national registries, and other health platforms.

### SMART (Substitutable Medical Applications, Reusable Technologies)
- HealthyMother is built as a modular, standards-based web application, making it easy to extend or integrate with SMART-on-FHIR platforms.
- The app's authentication and data access patterns are designed to be compatible with SMART principles, supporting secure, user-centric health data access in the future.

**In summary:** HealthyMother is ready for real-world health system integration, supporting DAK workflows, FHIR data models, and SMART app extensibility.
